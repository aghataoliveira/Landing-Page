# Landing Page Project
This project is focused in real-world scenarios of the DOM manipulation.
It has 4 sections, and it was originally cloned from a Udacity repository.
The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. 
The nav Menu is created **dinamically** directly from the app.js file.
